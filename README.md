Easy to use Python code to avoid errors while preparing chemical solutions.

This easy software will help you preparing chemical solutions in the lab.
It has been written to help students double check their calculations before preparing any solution.  

## Options

Here I list the options of this software.

### Weight

This is helpful when you have a chemical compound as powder and you have to prepare a solution with a certain molarity and a certain volume. This will calculate the grams of the reagent needed to prepare that solution.

### Molarity

This has to be used when you have to calculate the molarity of a solution, starting from the mass of the compound, the molecular weight and the volume.

### Volume

This has to be used when you have chemical compound as powder and you have to prepare a solution with a certain molarity. This will calculate the volume of the solute in which the powder has to be dissolved.
