Easy to use Python code to avoid errors while preparing chemical solutions.  Code is simple and it my first attempt with programming and Python :)

This easy software will help you preparing chemical solutions in the lab.  Hope it might help some high school, BSc or MSc students preparing solutions.

## Options

Here I list the options of this software.

### Weight

This is helpful when you have a chemical compound as powder and you have to prepare a solution with a certain molarity and a certain volume. This will calculate the grams of the reagent needed to prepare that solution.

### Molarity

This has to be used when you have to calculate the molarity of a solution, starting from the mass of the compound, the molecular weight and the volume.

### Volume

This has to be used when you have chemical compound as powder and you have to prepare a solution with a certain molarity. This will calculate the volume of the solute in which the powder has to be dissolved.
